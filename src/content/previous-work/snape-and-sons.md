title: "Snape & Sons"
about: "<p>Based in the leafy suburb of Cheadle Hulme Snape & Sons is an independent family run hardware and homewares store. Established in 1936 they have been serving the residents of their village with the essentials for home and garden for over 80 years.</p><p> Even with trading for such a long time the compnay had never had a logo or used consistent identity (using both “Snape’s Housewares’ and ‘Snape’s Household Stores simultaneously) in their marketing or day to day business. After our initial strategy meeting it became clear that this would need addressing in response to growing local competition.</p>"
