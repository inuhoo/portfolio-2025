H1 — Brand strategy and design for independent retail businesses.

Build a brand that customers understand, trust, and choose.

⸻

Introduction

I’m Adam Snape, a freelance brand strategist and designer based in the Peak District National Park. I help independent retail businesses create brands that are clear, consistent, and commercially effective.

Many retailers reach a stage where their brand starts to limit their growth. Customers hesitate because the message isn’t obvious. Visuals feel mismatched to the quality of the product. The website does the job, but not particularly well. Everything functions, but nothing works together — and the result is missed opportunities and lost sales.

A strong, aligned brand changes that.
It removes uncertainty, builds recognition, and makes your value self-evident. It gives customers confidence before they ever reach the checkout. Good branding is not decoration; it’s a tool for driving revenue and making better decisions across your business.

That’s the foundation of my work. Through structured brand strategy, clear visual identity design, and brand-led websites, I help retailers establish a brand that supports growth instead of restricting it — a brand that performs.

Services Overview

I work closely with independent retail businesses, offering strategic and design support without unnecessary layers or off-the-shelf packages. Every project is scoped to fit the business, the goals, and the resources available.

Brand Strategy

The thinking behind the brand: positioning, clarity, customer understanding, and messaging. A practical foundation that guides every decision and informs every piece of design.

Visual Identity Design

A coherent visual system built from strategy — logo, colour, typography, and brand rules that create consistency across every touchpoint.
(Logo design included, but always delivered within the wider identity.)

Web Design

Brand-led websites that balance clarity, usability, and commercial performance.
This includes Shopify ecommerce for retailers and brochure sites for product-led or locality-focused businesses.

Why Independent Retailers Work With Me

Strategic and creative in equal measure

With a background spanning mathematics, ecommerce management, and design, I work at the intersection of logic and creativity — ensuring your brand is not only visually strong but commercially sound.

Independent working with independents

I understand the pressures on SME retailers: tight margins, limited time, and the need for every investment to produce a clear return. My work is designed to support those realities, not ignore them.

A practical, structured approach

No jargon. No inflated complexity. Just clear process, transparent communication, and design rooted in strategy.

The Process

Every project follows a clear three-phase framework:
	1.	Discovery — positioning, customer personas, brand priorities
	2.	Design — visual identity, brand assets, website
	3.	Delivery — deployment, handover, ongoing support

This structure keeps every stage aligned, efficient, and measurable.
